This is a project for Buildroot and RPi 4 for blinking an LED with libgpiod,
and detecting button presses and toggling a button LED.

blinky uses libgpiod to blink an LED on GPIO 18.

gpio_button is a platform driver that uses a device tree overlay to map:
- GPIO 24: Button input (active-low, with hardware pull-up)
- GPIO 25: LED output (button status indicator)

Driver Features:
1. Debounced button handling:
   - Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) triggers on falling edge (button press).
   - 50ms software debounce timer ensures single event registration per press.
   - Debounce timer re-checks button state before signaling userspace.

2. Userspace event notification:
  - Blocking read() via wait queue: Userspace processes sleep until button events.
  - Atomic flag (button_event_flag) ensures safe cross-context synchronization.
  - Poll support for multiplexed I/O applications.

3. sysfs:
   - Exposes /sys/class/gpio_button/gpio_button_sysfs/led_status for LED control.
   - Accepts 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON) via ASCII input.

Flow:
- Button press -> ISR schedules debounce timer (atomic lock prevents retriggering).
- After 50ms: Timer callback verifies stable LOW state -> sets button_event_flag.
- wait_queue (button_wait) wakes blocked userspace readers.
- read() returns '1' (ASCII) and clears flag â†’ LED toggled via SysFS.
